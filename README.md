# BicycleBehaviorAnalysis
## Introduction
Our project has four parts: bicycle's tracking by detection,3D reconstruction,ellipse detection and pose recovery.
## Tracking by Detection
We use TBD(Tracking by Detection) method to track bicycle's in one camera. We choose --DeepSORT--[^1] as our tracker and --YOLOv3[^2]-- as detector which has been modified using transfer learning.
